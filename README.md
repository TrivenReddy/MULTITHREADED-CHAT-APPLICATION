##DESCRIPTION:A chat application is an excellent way to understand network programming in Java. This project focuses on creating a real-time client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously. The implementation consists of two main components:
The Server – Listens for incoming client connections and relays messages.
The Client – Connects to the server and allows users to send and receive messages.
Used Eclipse IDE to develop and execute the project.
The project consists of two Java files:
Server.java – Handles multiple client connections.
Client.java – Runs on individual client machines to communicate with the server.

Key Features of the Server:
Multi-threading: Each client gets a dedicated thread.
Broadcasting Messages: Messages from one client are sent to all connected clients.
Graceful Handling of Disconnections: If a client disconnects, the server removes it from the active list.

Key Features of the Client:
Real-time Communication: Clients receive messages in real time.
User Input Handling: Reads user input using Scanner and sends it to the server.
Threaded Message Reading: A separate thread listens for incoming messages from the server.
